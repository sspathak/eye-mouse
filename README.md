Control your PC's mouse by just looking at the screen! (proof of concept)
This program uses machine learning to predict the screen coordinates of where you are looking

The model included only works for PCs with cameras at the top of the screen
Additionally the model has been trained only on one person.

data-generator.py can be used to generate your own traning data


Data Generator:
Remember to modify coordinate values before running the program (Images generated will have these coordinates in their file name)
